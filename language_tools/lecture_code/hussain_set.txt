say there are 4 elements and 6 queries

8 5 3 1
1
2
3
4
6
8

at every query we need to divide the maximum element in the
array by 2. after dividing if it is greater than 0 we insert the
quotient back into the array

so first 8 is max, 8/2 = 4 > 0 so insert back we need to print 8 and move on
now array is 4 5 3 1

now the max is 5, 5/2 = 2 > 0 insert back print 5
now array is 4 2 3 1

max is 4, 4/2 = 2 >0, print 4
now array is 2 2 3 1 

max is 3, 3/2 = 1, print 3
now array is 2 2 1 1

max is 2, 2/2 = 1 print 2
now array is 1 2 1 1

max is 2
